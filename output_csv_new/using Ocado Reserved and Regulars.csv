"Hi, can you tell me how Ocado regulars work with my recurring slot please?"
I am trying to set up my ocado regulars because I have started a new weekly delivery. I can't seem to get the right things in there and then check out. I seem to keep adding stuff to future shops and not sure how to complete my edit.I think i am confused.
"i have set up choose my regulars with what i want my regular shop to be. But it does not appear in my trolley ... and you still try to offer me your suggested shop, which is not what i want!!! Please can you tell me how to get my 'choose my regulars'"
I think this regular oders and reserved order and my list is all a bit confusing. It would be easier if my regular orders was the same as my reserved orders
I use Ocado Reserved will my Regulars be added to my order automatically?

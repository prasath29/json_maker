Could you just confirm that I have not duplicated my order? Thanks
Hello can you confirm order is going to address?
how do I open my current order to check what I have got in the basket
"I amended my order on monday, cancelling lots of things & adding new bits. Ive just recvd my original order ! I dont understand whats happened"
"I have had a delivery this morning that I thought was coming tonighthowevervit came this morning , I now have a text to say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming tonight , I hope this is error as I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want double delivery"
I was checking my order for delivery on Monday 20th but suddenly I seem to have another full shopping cart which I didn't order currently. I don't need it but I'm concerned I might lose the order for Monday if I try to cancel it.
Is there a way I can see all my old orders?
My order has reverted to a previous order
My payment seems NOT to have gone thru. But the payment screen showed that AmEx had verified my card and it was OK. Then the Ocado Offers page appeared in place of the verification screen.
Not sure if checked out
show all items in my trolley to be delivered tomorrow
Things have been added to my order when I edited that I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realise which i didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need.
when did i last buy cucumbers
Where can I find the details of my order?

My order has been cancelled due to the payment not going through. However there was enough money on the card to pay for the order. And now I want to reorder but it is not charging me the same price
My payment declined IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come on to re pay and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve lost my slot
"My payment didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go through, I have fixed the issue and I am trying to re order it now but now my original slot is gone. Can I still get that slot back?"

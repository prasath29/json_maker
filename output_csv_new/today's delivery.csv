apologies but I mixed up my delivery day and missed you. I spoke with the driver. Can I rebook for tomorrow?
Do I have to be in for my delivery?
Due today 730-830 I now need to take my baby to urgent care leaving at 745
"Hello, I'm meant to get a shop tonight but my car has broken down"
"Hi, the delivery is going to be late and I have to go, what can I do?"
I have a delivery due at 8-9am but I am sorry there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to be anyone home to accept it. I am happy to pay for it as realise
I have a delivery scheduled for today but wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be home
I have an delivery scheduled tonight but I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be at home
"I won't be home for my delivery this evening, can I change it?"
I'm not going to be in
I'm not in
Major problem. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been waiting for my order and I have now realised that I have ordered it for 11pm instead of 11 am. We wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be in then what can I do?
We are not going to be at home for our delivery today. Our daughter has gone into Labour in another part of the country and we are about to go there
wonâ€™t be able to be there

Hi I was wondering why I have to spend Ã‚Â£90 just to get some groceries delivered
"Hi, I had a reserved delivery for Thursday which stopped being held as soon as I was about to checkout. I then changed it for Sunday but suddenly the minimum spend changed from the usual Ã‚Â£40 to Ã‚Â£90 and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have enough things I need to rea"
how much do I need to spend in my christmas order
How much will the delivery charge be added if I don't pay 40 pounds?
I just want some little moons please
If I just make an order of 4 boxes of little moons will it turn up or does it have to be a big shop?
Is there a minimum amount to book a delivery
Minimum shop
order delivery for order amount Ã‚Â£20m
So I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t order under Ã‚Â£40?
"Sorry, yes my order seems to show an out of order item that brings my total cost below what Ocado allow for delivery?"

Why do I have to order Ã‚Â£90 pounds worth of goods?

1 whole crate missing. what's going on?
6 boxes of Peroni. 4 boxes of Alphabites cereal. 1 small pizza. This is around Ã‚Â£50 of products. Which i need asap. Therefore a refund will not suffice as i do not want to pay for delivery again. This must have been 4 boxes minimum on your Ocado vehicle
A lot of my shopping is missing
A lot of the delivery is missing
alot of products ordered on 19/03/21 never turned up or was i given a refund why not?
Around 15 items haven't been delivered but are on receipt
Damages items and whole tote not delivered
For the second time running all our frozen items are missing - yet I was told that everything was being delivered and there were no substitutions - we have had mistakes with our last three orders which is unlike Ocado

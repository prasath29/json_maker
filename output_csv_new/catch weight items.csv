Hi got a query on pricing of leg of lamb from todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivery
"hi there, the natoora pecorino is priced at Ã‚Â£6.99 but in the receipt i'm getting charged Ã‚Â£8.18"
"Hi, I have downloaded the receipt of the delivery due today. I am confused about the price listed for the 2 lamb neck fillets. What is the additional Ã‚Â£4.56"
"how can the typically priced at Ã‚Â£5.60 steaks turn out to be *.32. , Ã‚Â£8.07 and Ã‚Â£7plus"
how much will I be charged
My order today included a fillet steak priced at Â£16 .80 for approx.300 kg. The item delivered was for.229 kg and the price on the packet was Â£10.99.
Rib of beef smaller than minimum weight
"So o ordered a thoughtful producer whole chicken which arrived with my order. I expected it to be around 2kg give or take a 100g. It was over 3kg so cost a third more than I wanted it to, they always used to be around 2kg whatever they are doing to breed"
The lamb neck fillet in last nightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s order is only .170kg. The website says average 300g. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s below the minimum of 200kg and unfortunately too small for purpose.
What is a catch weight item?

I AM TRYING TO ARRANGE OCCADO RESERVED SLOT. I AM ENTERING NEW PAYMENT DETAILS WHICH ARE NOT BEING ACCEPTED - WHY?
I cannot enter the refund value column
I can't click on Terms & Conditions
i do not seem able to enter a value for the products that are damaged
I have completed my request a refund - and it will not send. It states 'pending'!
I have previously used it but can't access it now.
I have the reserve page stuck on my PC and I cannot continue with my order change for Friday. How do I remove it?
i haven't been able to use the app for more than 16 hours as the trolley won't sync and it wont let me cancel the changes either. its stuck in a loop. I would like to be able to use one touch additions but cant.
I keep pressing edit order and nothing is happening

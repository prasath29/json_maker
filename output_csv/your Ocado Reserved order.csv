your Ocado Reserved order
and I keep getting deliveries oif things I dont need so I just want to clear.
Can I edit favourites because when you reserve a date for an order it takes too long to delete everything
can you advise how I can remove add stuff from permanent list
Can't manage to place my order - I don't like this Favourite list - it gets automatically added to my trolley every time I want to place an order - please get rid of it I DO NOT WANT IT. I'd rather choose at the time of placing my order. Totally confused

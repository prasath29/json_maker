I had a text saying my order was going to be late due to fire at warehouse but I had the late slot 11pm to midnight - I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want it any later than that as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting too late. Should we cancel it? later
"I received my recent order yesterday which was booked between 2pm and 3pm, this order wasnt received until 4pm, this was not what I wanted as I had to cancel an appointment"
I would like a refund for my delivery charge as the delivery was late
"It was 40 minutes late, which brought it into the slot which would have been free of charge (I paid Ã‚Â£2.99 for my slot)."

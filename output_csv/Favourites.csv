How do i stop all items being added to favourites

I need to delete items from favourites and know I need to change the heart but the list is not saved
I regularly update my favourite list by just pressing the heart symbol but the products keep appearing in my favourites week on week
Is there a way to stop things automatically getting added to my favourites?
My Mother-in-law died 2 weeks ago. We used to order food for her too. How do I permanently remove the things she used to have so they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t appear in the basket or scroll through every time I place an order?

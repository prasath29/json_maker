the symbols on the slot booking page
All the slots places show - on them. Does that mean the slots have not been released
does a hyphen type line mean there are no slots first time so not sure what it looks like if there were slots available

"IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m trying to book my delivery slot for Sunday 14th, the first slot in the afternoon, but there is a dash in the box for that time and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure how to select it"
If I press on a white slot is it available
"It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say no slots available , just lines through each time"
It doesn't say not available. I just get lots of dashes
"There are no delivery slots but the slots are showing green, is that correct?"
There arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t any little green vans showing
What do the symbols on the slot booking page mean?

"When I try to pick a delivery spot, nothing happens. There is just a grey line in the middle of each slot"

missing item with no substitution
Could you please tell why is there no lily's kitchen dog food? I am going to have to cancel my shop and go to Waitrose?
Do you not provide substitutions for products out of stock?
For three weeks in a row I have ordered The Juicy Meat Co lean mince. Every week it is apparently out of stock although it never says so on the website. What is really annoying though is that apparently you have no other mince beef available to substitute
"Hello, just been informed that both my bottles of red wine are not in the order today"
Hi why hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t my gluten free bread been substituted ? It is an essential I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t buy else where abs the reason I ordered from you!
I didn't receive any logs yesterday however they've been showing in stock?
I have just been told one item would not be delivered
I received an additional item I wasn't charged for.
I said some effort should have been made to replace /substitute the yogurts.
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to know why some missing gems havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been substituted please
no substitutes
no substitutions provided
Not happy a substitution was not sent
Not interested in getting our money back for the yogurts that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t arrive we wanted substitutions .
Some items are not available but I have already been charged. Why is this?
"Some items I ordered havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been picked or substituted eg watercress,rocket, frozen dumplings"
The yogurts should have been replaced not just missing . We are both over 70with health issues . Surely you have other fruit yogurts?
There is a missing item from my delivery today and it says there are no substitutions available. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the case and I have been over charged. I am therefore complaining.
Y did I not receive bread substitute today

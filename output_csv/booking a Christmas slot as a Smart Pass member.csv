"Hi, I just want to check as I do have smart pass, i don't need to worry about my xmas delivery"
I can't book a christmas slot. I was emailed yesterday to say that as a smart pass user I could book a slot as of today.. Please help.

I have paid for an ocado pass but I can't book my Christmas delivery
"I have still not heard about my Christmas Slot, all my friends on Smart Pass have. I was missed off last year & not very happy"

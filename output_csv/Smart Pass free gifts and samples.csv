Smart Pass free gifts and samples
"According to the information on the website, as a Smart Pass customer. I should receive samples, gifts, and a subscription to our magazine. Since i joined four months ago, I have only had one issue of the magazine and one 'free sample' of peppa pig sweets"
Can you please tell me how I can get the Ocado Life magazine. I'm a smart pass holder and never get this delivered to me.
How come I never receive any product samples?
It says I get free gifts and samples with Smart Pass What are they?
"Why my smart pass offers,gifts etc stopped"
